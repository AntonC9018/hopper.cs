# Overview

This is the C# rework of [my previous project](https://github.com/AntonC9018/Dungeon-Hopper), which was programmed with lua.

This particular repo is just the `Model` part of the project.

The documentation does not exist, although some general concepts like Chains, Tinkers, Retouchers and Decorators (called Behaviors in this code) as well as some others, which all have been described in the [docs for the prior version](https://antonc9018.github.io/Dungeon-Hopper-Docs/), are present in this version too, although in a somewhat different form.

The file `main.cs` contains some demo code. You may look through it to assess the capabilities of the system.

# View

There is one WIP `View` implementation base on unity, see [this repo](https://github.com/AntonC9018/hopper-unity).
